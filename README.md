A Twist of Freight
Freight is the backbone of our economy. As such, there is an endless supply of data on this subject and companies are constantly using this data to identify past, present, and future trends to identify supply chain transportation opportunities. We are interested in analyzing the movement of freight into, within, and outside of each state in terms of tonnage, specific commodities, and value. 

Project Requirements:
Visualization must include: 
•	Python Flask RESTful API, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and 
•	At least one database (MongoDB, SQLite, etc.); and
•	Powered by a dataset with at least 100 records; and
•	At least one JS Library that we did not cover; and
•	Some level of user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes); and
•	At least 3 views in final presentation.
Project must fall into one of the following 3 tracks:
•	A custom creative D3.js project (nonstandard graph or chart)
•	A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly
•	A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data
